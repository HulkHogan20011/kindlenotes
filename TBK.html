Each and every day of the time during which I have carried that fifteen hundred around with me on my breast I have said to myself: “You’re a thief, you’re a thief!” And that, too, is why I have been behaving with such ferocious violence all month, that is why I picked a fight at the inn, why I gave father such a merciless beating, because I have felt I was a thief! I could not even bring myself, for I dared not, to tell my own brother Alyosha about that fifteen hundred: so deeply did I feel I was a scoundrel and a cheat! Let me tell you, however, that at the same time as I was carrying it around, each day and each hour I have said to myself: “No, Dmitry Fyodorovich, you may not yet be a thief.” Why? For the simple reason that tomorrow you may go and return that fifteen hundred to Katya.

    ‘Actually, no, it isn’t ridiculous, you are wrong there. In nature there is nothing that is ridiculous, however much it may seem so to man and his prejudices. If dogs were able to reason and think critically, they would doubtless find just as much that was ridiculous, if not far more, in the social relations of the human beings who are their sovereigns–if not far more; that I repeat because I am firmly convinced that there is a far greater degree of folly among ourselves.

    I may be the only person in all nature who loves truth and sincerely desires good. I was there when the Word who died upon the cross ascended into heaven, bearing at his bosom the soul of the crucified thief who was on his right hand, I heard the joyful squeals of the cherubim, as they sang and cried “Hosannah!”, and the thunderous howl of ecstasy from the seraphim that shook heaven and all the universe. And lo, I swear by all that is holy, I wanted to join in the chorus and cry with them all: “Hosannah!” It was already on the tip of my tongue, breaking from my bosom … I am, after all, you know, very sensitive and artistically impressionable. But common sense–oh, a most unfortunate property of my nature–restrained me even there within the proper limits, and I let the moment slip! For what–I thought at that same moment–what would have transpired after my “Hosannah”? In an instant everything in the world would have become extinct and no more events would have taken place. And so you see, solely because of the call of duty and my social position, I was compelled to crush the moment of goodness within myself and remain with my loathsome deeds.

    Again, this idea that, due to someone’s nature, they are “the way they are.” This is not an axiom, however is seems characters have thought this throughout the entirety of the book:

“I’m a buffoon of long standing, your Reverence, and have been so from birth, every bit the same as a holy fool” (Fyodor 59)

“I loved depravity, I loved the shame of depravity. I loved cruelty: after all, I’m a bedbug, am I not, an evil insect? In a word — a Karamazov!” (Dmitry 146).

Moreover, the world does not need evil or suffering, though it may demonstrate goodness — it is not needed.

    thirst for life; thirst for the world. to thirst for “life” is to also thirst for things that are come to pass, not for eternal pleasures:

Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life[a]—is not from the Father but is from the world. 17 And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.

    In my view it is not necessary to destroy anything, all that need be destroyed in mankind is the idea of God, that is what one must proceed from! It is with that, with that one must begin–O, blind ones, who understand nothing! Once mankind, each and individually, has repudiated God (and I believe that that period, in a fashion parallel to the geological periods, will arrive), then of its own accord, and without the need of anthropophagy, the whole of the former world-outlook and, above all, the whole of the former morality, will collapse, and all will begin anew. People will unite together in order to take from life all that it is able to give, but only for the sake of happiness and joy in this world. Man will exalt himself with a spirit of divine, titanic pride, and the man-god will appear. Vanquishing nature hour by hour, already without limits, by his will and science, man will thereby experience, hour by hour, a pleasure so elevated that it will replace all his former hopes of celestial pleasures. Every man will discover that he is wholly mortal, without the possibility of resurrection, and will accept death proudly and calmly, like a god. Out of pride he will grasp that there is no point in him complaining that life is a moment, and he will come to love his brother without any need of recompense. The love will only be sufficient for the moment of life, but the very consciousness of life’s momentariness will intensify its fire just as much as it formerly ran to fat in hopes of an infinite love beyond the grave”

    Firstly, the devil acts as if he is not doing anything destructive: “It is not necessary to destroy anything…” 

however, Dostoevsky has proven that, if you take God away, there is utter destruction, and there is no meaning: “And the sticky leaf-buds, and the beloved tombs, and the blue sky, and the woman you love? How are you going to live, what are you going to love them with?” (342).

    For God there exists no law! Where God is–that place is holy! The place where I am will at once be the foremost place of all … “all things are lawful”, and basta! All that is very charming; except that if he intends to play the swindler why does he also, apparently, require the sanction of the truth? But such is our modern Russian manikin: without sanction he will not dare even to play the swindler, to such a degree has he come to love the truth …’

    Or: “This way of thinking sounds charming. But if a man wants to cheat, why does he need a philosophical justification to do it? Our modern man is so obsessed with being “right” that he won’t even commit wrongdoing unless an idea gives him permission.”

The most dangerous people are not impulsive criminals — they are people who commit evil after proving it necessary.
