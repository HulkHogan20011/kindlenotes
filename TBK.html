    See previous highlight on what the devil looks like. 

As mentioned multiple times throughout my notes, as a common christian, is is easy to think: “well, at least I do not do XYZ, I am not like that person.”

We have come to believe that, somehow, the most obvious and terrible sins are those depraved according to society, such as homosexuality, drunkenness, sex before marriage, or drug addiction. 

However, as is made clear by the devil’s attire and gentle character, sin is sin. Evil is evil, and it is often wrapped in a bow. Why are we to think that, just because we do not outwardly display our sin, that we are unlike those who crucified Christ? That what we do and our individual sin is somehow not as bad as others, comparatively? 

"So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.” Romans 3:16

“‘Once a person has stepped onto the lowest rung he has absolutely no option but to climb to the highest one’
‘You mean it’s better not to get on the ladder at all?'
‘Whoever is able had better not get on at all’” (147).

    “adoration and joy”

Satan’s job is to negate: he represents an absence of good. 

To crucify can be read here as purifying through power. There is some truth to this: praising alone is not enough; there cannot be faith or belief without the testing of doubt, or the absence of something to not believe in, or to turn away from. 

Here, we see that actions = proof of that. Though Satan makes this statement, his actions demonstrate his fruits are dead, and he is just straight up lying.

There is one certainty: if we are thinking, then we exist. Without God, there are no absolutes. Everything around us, if there is an “around us,”is being filtered through our conscience. But, there is a conscience, and we know that because we are thinking. 

Satan can, therefore, believe in himself, just as Ivan is. And, since this is a figment of Ivan’s imagination… well… Satan exists.

    Could have a twofold interpretation. 

Those without conscience can be those who are lawless and not bound by the chains of good or morality. 

On the other end, everyone has a conscience, and this in and of itself is a sign of divine morality:

    I may be the only person in all nature who loves truth and sincerely desires good. I was there when the Word who died upon the cross ascended into heaven, bearing at his bosom the soul of the crucified thief who was on his right hand, I heard the joyful squeals of the cherubim, as they sang and cried “Hosannah!”, and the thunderous howl of ecstasy from the seraphim that shook heaven and all the universe. And lo, I swear by all that is holy, I wanted to join in the chorus and cry with them all: “Hosannah!” It was already on the tip of my tongue, breaking from my bosom … I am, after all, you know, very sensitive and artistically impressionable. But common sense–oh, a most unfortunate property of my nature–restrained me even there within the proper limits, and I let the moment slip! For what–I thought at that same moment–what would have transpired after my “Hosannah”? In an instant everything in the world would have become extinct and no more events would have taken place. And so you see, solely because of the call of duty and my social position, I was compelled to crush the moment of goodness within myself and remain with my loathsome deeds.

    Ivan’s reflection here:

“If everyone must suffer in order with their suffering to purchase eternal harmony, what do young children have to do with it, tell me, please? [T]here can be no question of solidarity in sin among young children” (319). 

"And if the sufferings of children have gone to replenish the sum of suffering that was needed in order to purchase the truth, then I declare in advance that no truth, not even the whole truth, is worth such a price” (320).

    Oh, I love the dreams of my young and ardent friends a-tremble with the thirst for life!

    thirst for life; thirst for the world. to thirst for “life” is to also thirst for things that are come to pass, not for eternal pleasures:

Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life[a]—is not from the Father but is from the world. 17 And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. (1 John 2:15-17)

    In my view it is not necessary to destroy anything, all that need be destroyed in mankind is the idea of God, that is what one must proceed from! It is with that, with that one must begin–O, blind ones, who understand nothing! Once mankind, each and individually, has repudiated God (and I believe that that period, in a fashion parallel to the geological periods, will arrive), then of its own accord, and without the need of anthropophagy, the whole of the former world-outlook and, above all, the whole of the former morality, will collapse, and all will begin anew. People will unite together in order to take from life all that it is able to give, but only for the sake of happiness and joy in this world. Man will exalt himself with a spirit of divine, titanic pride, and the man-god will appear. Vanquishing nature hour by hour, already without limits, by his will and science, man will thereby experience, hour by hour, a pleasure so elevated that it will replace all his former hopes of celestial pleasures. Every man will discover that he is wholly mortal, without the possibility of resurrection, and will accept death proudly and calmly, like a god. Out of pride he will grasp that there is no point in him complaining that life is a moment, and he will come to love his brother without any need of recompense. The love will only be sufficient for the moment of life, but the very consciousness of life’s momentariness will intensify its fire just as much as it formerly ran to fat in hopes of an infinite love beyond the grave”

    Firstly, the devil acts as if he is not doing anything destructive: “It is not necessary to destroy anything…” 

however, Dostoevsky has proven that, if you take God away, there is utter destruction, and there is no meaning: “And the sticky leaf-buds, and the beloved tombs, and the blue sky, and the woman you love? How are you going to live, what are you going to love them with?” (342). 

"in this same circumstance rests the whole of the natural law, and that if one were to destroy mankind’s faith in its own immortality, nothing would be immoral, all things would be lawful, even anthropophagy […] Without immortality there can be no virtue” (94-95).

"While I am tormented by the question of God. That alone torments me. For what if he does not exist? What if Rakitin is right, and he is an artificial idea dreamed up by mankind? Then, if he does not exist, man is the boss of the earth, of creation. Magnificent! Only how will he be virtuous without God? That is the question. I think about it all the time. For whom will he love then, whom will man love? To whom will he render gratitude, to whom will he sing his hymn?” (Dmitry 757)

    For God there exists no law! Where God is–that place is holy! The place where I am will at once be the foremost place of all … “all things are lawful”, and basta! All that is very charming; except that if he intends to play the swindler why does he also, apparently, require the sanction of the truth? But such is our modern Russian manikin: without sanction he will not dare even to play the swindler, to such a degree has he come to love the truth …’

    Or: “This way of thinking sounds charming. But if a man wants to cheat, why does he need a philosophical justification to do it? Our modern man is so obsessed with being “right” that he won’t even commit wrongdoing unless an idea gives him permission.”

The most dangerous people are not impulsive criminals — they are people who commit evil after proving it necessary.

Ideas = nascency for crimes 

Here, it is revealed that all crimes or sins come with some sort of justification, no matter what it may be, and this seems to be the overlying issues of the novel: everything would then be justifiable.

    With all that said and done, praise be to God, we have hope:

"‘No, I cannot. Brother,’ Alyosha said suddenly, his eyes flashing, ‘just now you said: “Is there in all the world a Being that could forgive and have the right to forgive?” Well, that Being does exist, and It can forgive everything, everyone, man and woman alike, and for everything, because It gave Its innocent blood for all things and all men. You have forgotten about It, but on It the edifice is founded, and this it is that people will exclaim to It: “Just and true art Thou, O Lord, for Thy ways are made plain. ‘” (321)
