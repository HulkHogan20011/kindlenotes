    It is not miracles that incline a realist towards faith. The true realist, if he is not a believer, will invariably find within himself the strength and the ability not to believe in miracles either, and if a miracle stands before him as an incontrovertible fact, he will sooner disbelieve his senses than admit that fact. And even if he does admit it, it will be as a fact of nature, but one that until now has been obscure to him. In the realist it is not faith that is born of miracles, but miracles of faith. Once the realist believes, his realism inexorably compels him to admit miracles too. The Apostle Thomas declared that he would not believe until he saw, and when he saw, said: ‘My Lord and my God.’ Was it the miracle that had made him believe? The likeliest explanation is that it was not, and that he came to believe for the sole reason that he wanted to believe and, perhaps, in the inmost corners of his being already fully believed, even when he said: ‘Except I shall see … I will not believe.’ 1

    the criminal seldom repents, as the most recent theories confirm him in the notion that his crime is not a crime at all, but merely an act of revolt against an unjustly oppressive power. Society amputates him from itself by means of a power that triumphs over him quite mechanically, and accompanies this excommunication with hatred (such at least are the stories that they tell about themselves in Europe)–with hatred and the most complete indifference and neglect concerning his subsequent fate as a brother to the rest. Thus it all takes place without the slightest ecclesiastical compassion, for in many instances there are no longer any Churches there at all, and all that remain are churchmen and fine ecclesiastical buildings, as the Churches there have themselves long striven to evolve from the lower form of life–the Church–to the higher form–the State–in order to vanish in it completely. That, at any rate, appears to be the situation in the Lutheran lands. In Rome, however, a State has been proclaimed in place of a Church for a thousand years now. The result is that the criminal no longer perceives himself as a limb of the Church and, excommunicated, falls into despair. And if he does return to society, he does it not infrequently with such hatred that society excommunicates him, as it were, from itself. What the end of this is you may judge for yourselves. In many instances it would appear that the same thing takes place among us here in Russia; but the fact of the matter is that, in addition to the established courts, there is in our land also the Church, which never breaks off its communion with the criminal as one of its dear and beloved sons,

    according to Euclid can on no account converge upon earth may yet do so somewhere in infinity. And so, my lad, I’ve decided that if I can’t even understand that, then how am I to understand about God? I meekly confess that I do not possess the faculties needed to solve such questions, the mind I have is a Euclidean, earthbound one, and so how are we to make inferences about that which is not of this world? And indeed I advise you never to think about that, Alyosha, and least of all concerning God and whether He exists or not. Those are all questions unsuited to a mind that has been created with an awareness of only three dimensions. <p>So, I accept God, and not only do I do so willingly, I also accept His supreme wisdom and His purpose, both of which are completely unknown to us,</p> I believe in the order, the meaning of life, I believe in eternal harmony–one in which we shall all as it were fuse together–I believe in the Word towards which the universe strives and which once “was with God” and which is God, well, and so on into infinity. Too many words have been wasted apropos of all that. It looks as though I’m already on the right track, doesn’t it? <p>So let me tell you that in the last analysis, this world of God’s–I don’t accept it, even though I know that it exists, and I don’t admit its validity in any way. It isn’t God I don’t accept, you see; it’s the world created by Him, the world of God I don’t accept and cannot agree to accept.</p> Let me qualify that: like a young babe, I am convinced that our sufferings will be healed and smoothed away, that the whole offensive comedy of human conflict will disappear like a pathetic mirage, like the infamous fabrication of the Euclidean human mind, as weak and undersized as an atom, and that ultimately, during the universal finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, there will occur and become manifest something so precious that it will be sufficient for all hearts, for the soothing of all indignation, the redemption of all men’s evil-doings, all the blood that has been shed by them, will be sufficient not only to make it possible to forgive but even to justify all the things that have happened to men–and even if all that, all of it, makes itself manifest and becomes reality, I will not accept it and do not want to accept it! Even if the parallel lines converge and I actually witness it, I shall witness it and say they have converged, but all the same I shall not accept it. That is my essence, Alyosha, that is my thesis. Now I have expressed it to you seriously. I purposely began this conversation with you in as stupid a manner as possible, but I’ve led it up to my confession, because that is the only thing required. It wasn’t necessary for you to hear about God, but simply to learn what your beloved brother lives by. And I have told it.’

    ‘Why, the fact that I had stolen the money, that is what! Oh my God, you horrify me with your lack of comprehension! Each and every day of the time during which I have carried that fifteen hundred around with me on my breast I have said to myself: “You’re a thief, you’re a thief!” And that, too, is why I have been behaving with such ferocious violence all month, that is why I picked a fight at the inn, why I gave father such a merciless beating, because I have felt I was a thief! I could not even bring myself, for I dared not, to tell my own brother Alyosha about that fifteen hundred: so deeply did I feel I was a scoundrel and a cheat! Let me tell you, however, that at the same time as I was carrying it around, each day and each hour I have said to myself: “No, Dmitry Fyodorovich, you may not yet be a thief.” Why? For the simple reason that tomorrow you may go and return that fifteen hundred to Katya.

    In my view it is not necessary to destroy anything, all that need be destroyed in mankind is the idea of God, that is what one must proceed from! It is with that, with that one must begin–O, blind ones, who understand nothing! <p></p>Once mankind, each and individually, has repudiated God (and I believe that that period, in a fashion parallel to the geological periods, will arrive), then of its own accord, and without the need of anthropophagy, the whole of the former world-outlook and, above all, the whole of the former morality, will collapse, and all will begin anew. People will unite together in order to take from life all that it is able to give, but only for the sake of happiness and joy in this world. Man will exalt himself with a spirit of divine, titanic pride, and the man-god will appear. Vanquishing nature hour by hour, already without limits, by his will and science, man will thereby experience, hour by hour, a pleasure so elevated that it will replace all his former hopes of celestial pleasures. Every man will discover that he is wholly mortal, without the possibility of resurrection, and will accept death proudly and calmly, like a god. Out of pride he will grasp that there is no point in him complaining that life is a moment, and he will come to love his brother without any need of recompense. The love will only be sufficient for the moment of life, but the very consciousness of life’s momentariness will intensify its fire just as much as it formerly ran to fat in hopes of an infinite love beyond the grave”</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">however, Dostoevsky has proven that, if you take God away, there is utter destruction, and there is no meaning: “And the sticky leaf-buds, and the beloved tombs, and the blue sky, and the woman you love? How are you going to live, what are you going to love them with?” (342). </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"in this same circumstance rests the whole of the natural law, and that if one were to destroy mankind’s faith in its own immortality, nothing would be immoral, all things would be lawful, even anthropophagy […] Without immortality there can be no virtue” (94-95).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"While I am tormented by the question of God. That alone torments me. For what if he does not exist? What if Rakitin is right, and he is an artificial idea dreamed up by mankind? Then, if he does not exist, man is the boss of the earth, of creation. Magnificent! Only how will he be virtuous without God? That is the question. I think about it all the time. For whom will he love then, whom will man love? To whom will he render gratitude, to whom will he sing his hymn?” (Dmitry 757)</p>

         <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A prejudice is typically understood as an irrational, inherited, or socially conditioned belief, not a moral absolute. By framing murder this way, the speaker suggests that even the most fundamental moral prohibitions may be culturally conditioned rather than inherently true.

Paying is something we dislike horribly, while on the other hand we love to receive, and this in everything. Oh, give us, give us every possible blessing of life (it must be every possible one, for more cheaply we will not be reconciled) and in particular do not hinder our disposition in any way, and then we too shall demonstrate that we are able to be good and beautiful.
